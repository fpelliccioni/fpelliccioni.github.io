My name is Fernando Pelliccioni. I am a computer programmer for over 20 years.
I’ve been working in several industries for more than 16 years, from telecom to game industry.

I started this blog because I want to share what I learned about components programming from the work of Alexander Stepanov.

I’ll try to write the code of the articles using several programming languages ​​of which I have varying degrees of knowledge.
I would like to write code (with help of other people) in C++, C#, Java, Python, Javascript, Haskell, Eiffel and assembly languages​​. Please, feel free to send me a comment if you find any mistake.


<!-- This is built on Semantic.gs grid framework which I edited a bit to make it fluid. I hope you enjoy using, forking, whatevering this theme as much as I did making it. 

### Features
* flexible, uses max-width for responsive goodness
* responsive drop down menu
* retina images using @2x
* post loop in the footer showing 3 latest post
* custom portfolio page for case studies

### Acknowledgements
I utilized my own HTML templates, but had no prior knowledge of liquid nor the required Jekyll system file format. I took [Michael Rose](http://twitter.com/mmistakes)'s theme [Minimal Mistakes](http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/). Having a prebuilt archive and the YAML front-matter already set up was a great help. 

 The lovely font shown here is Calendas. For full splendor on your blog, I suggest you [head over and buy that](http://calendasplus.com/). The full family is 3 weights and costs $3. Many thanks to Daniel Bruce for the wonderful Entypo icons. Those can be picked up at [entypo.com](http://entypo.com), but are included with the source files. It's also <b>retina ready</b> via retina.js. Check out how that works over at [retinajs.com](http://retinajs.com).

### The Name
Balzac was a famous writer, known for his beautiful prose. I read some Balzac in school, but mostly feel comfort in the name of my favorite coffee shop in Stratford, Ontario.  -->
