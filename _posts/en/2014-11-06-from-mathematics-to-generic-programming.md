The new book by Alexander Stepanov, and his colleague Daniel Rose, is about to go on sale.

The book is based on the ["Algorithmic Journeys"](http://www.stepanovpapers.com/) course taught by Alex at A9.

I had the honor of reviewing the draft version, and I can say it's a wonderful book!  
It combines mathematics, programming and history in a gorgeous and unique way. (It amazes me the knowledge that this guy has.)  
It is a pleasure to read.

I enjoyed reading it the same way I enjoyed watching the videos of the course.  
I strongly recommend it for all programmers who love their profession.

You can pre order it on [Amazon here](http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Generic-Programming-Alexander-Stepanov/dp/0321942043/).

Eager to have the printed version in my hands.  
(If my friends from Argentina Customs let me)

Thanks Alex!
