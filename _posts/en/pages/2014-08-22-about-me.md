My name is Fernando Pelliccioni. I am a second-generation computer programmer (my father is a programmer). If my memory serves me, I am a programmer since I was 9 years old (maybe earlier).

I started this blog because I want to share some thoughts and what I've learned over the years with respect to computer programming.

I would love to write about topics that are somewhat forgotten by modern programmers, like Algorithms, Data Structures, Mathematics, Computer architecture, Low-Level computer stuff, etc...

I will include references to the work of people I consider the greatest of our discipline, as Edsger Dijkstra, Donald Knuth, Alexander Stepanov, etc ...

Please, feel free to send me any comments you considers.  
I hope you like it.

-Fernando
