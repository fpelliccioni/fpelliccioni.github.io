Hello!

Here is the the link to the slides of my talk entitled ["Introduction to Generic Programming"](http://prezi.com/fxhtgwvubb10/?utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=copy&rc=ex0share) (Spanish resource), which was exhibited at the ["First C++ Buenos Aires Meeting"](http://www.meetup.com/cpp-ba/events/228427233/) on March 31, 2016.

At that meeting we had the pleasure to view the excellent talk provided by our colleague [Agustín (K-Ballo) Bergé](http://talesofcpp.fusionfenix.com/), entitled ["The C++ Way"](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1jygKCWf7aSQWt2NGlhTGtUdFM0VUVBQnU2SlQyNDQ1Z213), where he tells us about the new features incorporated in C++11 and C++14 .

I hope you like our presentations and you feel like to join [our community](www.meetup.com/cpp-ba/).

Kind regards!
