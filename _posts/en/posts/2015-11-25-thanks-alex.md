I got these two gifts.

![Elements of Programming and From Mathematics to Generic Programming]({{ site.url }}/images/EoPAndFM2GP.jpg)

These are two great books.
It is an honor for me that are autographed by one of the greatest of our discipline.

Do not deprive the pleasure of reading them.

[Elements of Programming on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Programming-Alexander-A-Stepanov/dp/032163537X/).

[From Mathematics to Generic Programming on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Generic-Programming-Alexander-Stepanov/dp/0321942043/).

Thanks again, Alex!
