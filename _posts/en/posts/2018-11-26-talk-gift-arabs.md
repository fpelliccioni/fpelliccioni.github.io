Hello!

I share with you the links to the video and films of my talk entitled _The Gift of the Arabs_, which was presented at the _Algorithms Study Group_ meetup in May 2017 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The content of my talk is based on [Three Algorithmic Journeys](http://stepanovpapers.com/Journeys/Journeys-0.3.pdf) and [From Mathematics to Generic Programming](https://www.amazon.es/Mathematics-Generic-Programming-Alexander-Stepanov/dp/0321942043) by [Alex Stepanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Stepanov).

It's my interpretation of what would have been his fourth episode, which was never presented, and would have had the same name.

Hope you like it!
