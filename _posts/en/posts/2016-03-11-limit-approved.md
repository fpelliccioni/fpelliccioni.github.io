On 11 March 2016, the plenary of the 40th Session of the [United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS)](http://www.un.org/depts/los/clcs_new/clcs_home.htm) approved the Recommendations on the Argentine presentation of the Outer Limit of the Continental Shelf. The Argentine Republic had presented the outer limit of the continental shelf of the whole Argentine territory - continental, insular and Antarctic Argentina - to the CLPC on April 21, 2009.

It has been an honor and pride for me to have been a member of this team and this project, which I hope will serve to improve the quality of life for all Argentines.
