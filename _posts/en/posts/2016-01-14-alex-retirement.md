Alex has retired.

This is a very nice Commemorative Stamp, by [Joyce Croft](https://twitter.com/joycecroft) and Alexander Zeyliger of [A9](http://a9.com/).

I have to confess that I feel sad because I really wished that Alex continue contributing ideas for much longer time.  
But he has retired and I'm happy for him.

I wish you an excellent and well-deserved rest with your family and friends.
