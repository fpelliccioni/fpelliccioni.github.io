On May 4, 2016, I was invited by the Argentine Minister of Foreign Affairs, [Susana Malcorra](https://twitter.com/SusanaMalcorra), to the *Vin d'honneur* (Wine of Honor) that took place in the Golden Hall of the San MartÃ­n Palace, on the occasion of the Salute to the members of the [National Commission on the Outer Limit of the Continental Shelf (COPLA)](http://www.plataformaargentina.gov.ar/en/(copla_i)).
