My name is Fernando Pelliccioni. I am a computer programmer for over 20 years.
I’ve been working in several industries for more than 16 years, from telecom to game industry.

I started this blog because I want to share what I learned about components programming from the work of Alexander Stepanov.

I’ll try to write the code of the articles using several programming languages ​​of which I have varying degrees of knowledge.
I would like to write code (with help of other people) in C++, C#, Java, Python, Javascript, Haskell, Eiffel and assembly languages​​. Please, feel free to send me a comment if you find any mistake.
