This is the first in a series of articles in which I want to transmit what I learned (or what I think I learned) from the books, papers and lectures of Alexander Stepanov.

These are the lessons that Alex gives us, and I want to show them in this series:

- Specify our algorithms correctly
- Programming must be based on a solid mathematical foundation
- Designing our API's consistently
- Not always the library implementations provided by the programming languages we use are correct, even though they are designed by "experts".
- The concept of Stability
- [*Generic programming* [1]](#Ref1), of course!
