subject: Possible errata in TAoCP Volume 3 Second Edition



Dear Professor Knuth,

First of all I want to thank you for your immense work. I really enjoy reading your books.

I think I found an error in TAoCP Volume 3 Second Edition.
On page 212 you describe the Doren's method for V4(8).
After seven steps we have the following:

        5 --- 6 --- 8
              |     |
             |     |
            |      7
           |
     1 --- 2 --- 4
                 |
                |
                3

Then you say that X1 and X8 are out of contention.

I think X8 is effectively out of the question, but not X1.
 
If I draw it this way:

          3 --- 4
                |
               |
              |
        1 --- 2 --- 6 --- 8
                    |     |
                   |     |
                  |     |
                  5     7

It is obvious that X1, X2 and X6 are smaller than X8 and so are X5 and X7, therefore, there are 5 elements that are effectively smaller than X8, so at most X8 may be in a sixth position.

But in the case of X1, we cannot ensure that X3, X5 and X7 are greater than X1.

Given the following example:
    X1=1, X2=2, X3=0, X4=3, X5=0, X6=3, X7=0, X8=4

We can verify that the conditions of the 7 steps are true:
    X1 < X2 and 
    X3 < X4 and 
    X2 < X4 and 
    X5 < X6 and 
    X7 < X8 and 
    X6 < X8 and 
    X2 < X6 

If we sort the data, they would be as follows:
    X3,X5,X7,X1,X2,X4,X6,X8
             ^^
Having been X1 in the fourth position.
Which means that it is not correct to leave X1 out of the discussion.        
If I am right I have found a mistake, otherwise I apologize for having wasted your time.

Thank you very much!
Yours sincerely,

Fernando Pelliccioni.
